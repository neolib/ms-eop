F5IPConfigValidator
========================================

First commandline argument is the path to output XML file generated by F5IPTagFinder.

By default the program outputs CSV text to console. You can use redirection to write output to a file.

For example you can put the following in Properties->Debug pane:
result.xml >result.csv

You may also want to set "Working directory".
