IpamFix
========================================

*IMPORTANT NOTE:

This program is not as stable and and mature as other two companion programs; it
is not meant to be used as a generic tool, instead it is a hotfix that does only
specific jobs. You should set breakpoints and start debugging mode. Be carefule!

*Commandline arguments:
Command result.xlsx output.csv

See Processor for "enum Command". Second argument is the path to manually
generated Excel spreadsheet based on output of F5IPConfigValidator program.

For example you can put the following in Properties->Debug pane:
FixTitle result200103.xlsx fixedtitles200112.csv

You may also want to set "Working directory".
